// Assign random goal score to appear at the start of each game in the HTML between 19-120
// assign to class: .goal


// Assign user's score to start at 0 at the start of each--assign to class: .userScore
// Have values from the images that have been clicked add to the user's score--assign to class: .userScore


// Assign random values to the HtML images with values between 1 - 12
// assign to classes: .overcast, .lightning, .snow, .tornado
// Hide these values until the user clicks each image (so they have to guess)


// restart the game every time the user wins or loses, maybe with a prompt so it's obvious that it restarted?
// add each win and loss to the appropriate category on the .scoreboard


// Maybe see about removing the figcaption beneath each image and instead have it show on.hover
